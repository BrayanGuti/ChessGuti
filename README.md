## 📖 Project Overview

This project aims to create a functional and engaging chess game. The primary focus is on the front-end development using React, which provides a dynamic and interactive user experience. The initial version of the game will be a single-player mode where users can play chess against themselves.

### 🌟 Future Plans

1. **Online Play**: We plan to enable online multiplayer functionality, allowing users to play chess against each other in real-time. 🌐
